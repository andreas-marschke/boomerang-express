# Understanding Data

Analyzing data and the impact a change on your website may have requires vast amounts of raw data on a site.
At best you want to know exactly what has happend at your customers end of the line.

Lets imagine we are hosting the shop for `http://localhost:4000` and a user came by to have a look at our
products. Every one of his clicks, views and moves on the sight may be monitored (local laws of personal data
storage may apply) and can be tracked.

## Plugins

Using the generated beacon script provided by the Boomerang Express Toolset adds a special array of elements to
the standard data captured from a site which tells us which plugins are enabled and baked into a specific release
of our script. You may use this for statistical purposes (ie. understanding *what* your users are interested in) or
abuse prevention so as to prevent unwanted third parties.

```json
"plugins": [
   "RT",
   "clicks",
   "DNS",
   "ResourceTiming",
   "BW",
   "GUID"
]
```
The entries reflect the names of the plugins added to the beacon script.

## Custom Timings

Custom timings if available are stored in a seperate object in the document they are created by adding timers to
the page as per the Boomerang documentation.

```json
"customTiming": {
  "body": 3,
  "scripts": 3
},
```

These reflect timings of the specific element as it has been interpreted by the browser. So an example implementation
in your HTML-code may be like this:

```html
<body>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    BOOMR.plugins.RT.startTimer("body");
  </script>
  <!-- body content ... -->
  <script type="text/javascript">
    BOOMR.plugins.RT.endTimer("body");
  </script>	
</body>
```

## Headers

Every browser request sends header data you can use this data to understand (for example) what referrer the request
came from or what languages are configured on the specific browser. You may use this data to see what your next
translation targets might be to enhance your app for a specific usergroup in a country you have not yet covered.

```json
  "headers": {
    "host": "localhost:4001",
    "connection": "keep-alive",
    "content-length": "8863",
    "pragma": "no-cache",
    "cache-control": "no-cache",
    "accept": [
      "text/html",
      "application/xhtml+xml",
      {
	"name": "application/xml",
	"rank": "0.9"
      },
      "image/webp",
      {
	"name": "*/*",
	"rank": "0.8"
      }
    ],
    "origin": "http://www.example.com",
    "content-type": "text/plain",
    "dnt": "1",
    "referer": "http://www.example.com/shop/article/2",
    "accept-encoding": [
      "gzip",
      " deflate"
    ],
    "accept-language": [
      "de-DE",
      {
	"name": "de",
	"rank": "0.8"
      },
      {
	"name": "en-US",
	"rank": "0.6"
      },
      {
	"name": "en",
	"rank": "0.4"
      }
    ]
  }
```

Notice that `accept`, `accept-language` and `accept-encoding` headers are split if necessairy if a
ranking/preference has been expressed by the browser. See [RFC 7240](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7240) for more
information on the subject of preferences in HTTP headers.

## User Agent Data

UserAgent data is split up and made aggregatable. Heres an example datapoint:

```json
  "agent": {
    "family": "Chrome",
    "major": "39",
    "minor": "0",
    "patch": "2171",
    "device": {
      "family": "Other",
      "major": "0",
      "minor": "0",
      "patch": "0"
    },
    "os": {
      "family": "Linux",
      "major": "0",
      "minor": "0",
      "patch": "0"
    }
  }
```

## Collections, Pages and States

Since beacon data is stored in type based tables referring to a user by his `id` the specific collection a
beacon is part of is saved in the `collection` key:

```json
  "collection": "demo-webpage"
```

The page you supplied in the beacon as well as the state of the page are also stored as keys with their respective
string values:

```json
  "page": "shop",
  "state": "article"
```

## Resources and External Page Elements

If we are using the resource timing plugin and enabled storing beacon data referring to resource timings in our
database backend we can use data referring to the timing of external assets loaded by the page.

Data sent with the beacon is serialized and stored in nested documents according to way the beacon was named.

```json
{
  "refer": "2QZzDFnzA8CbsvsY",
  "rt": {
    "name": "http://www.example.org/js/homepage.js",
    "in": {
      "type": "script"
    },
    "st": 301.1750000005122,
    "dur": 205.87599999271333,
    "fet": {
      "st": 301.1750000005122
    },
    "res": {
      "end": 507.05099999322556,
      "st": 455.72500000707805
    },
    "dns": {
      "st": 301.1750000005122,
      "end": 301.1750000005122
    },
    "con": {
      "st": 301.1750000005122,
      "end": 301.1750000005122
    },
    "req": {
      "st": 453.2469999976456
    }
  },
  "collection": "demo-webpage",
  "_id": "zr3qbYz1oFqgghuW"
}

```

Data here refers to the datapoints in the [ResourceTiming API plugin](http://www.lognormal.com/boomerang/doc/api/restiming.html).

The key `refer` points to the `id` of the beacon this data came with you may use this to average timings for a
specific time, set of beacons or to track how performance has changed between changes in your other infrastructure.
