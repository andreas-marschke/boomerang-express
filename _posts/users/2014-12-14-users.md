# Concepts

In this document we want to go over the basic concepts of how Boomerang Express works, how it
integrates into your system and what the benefits are of using Boomerang Express.


## WebApps, Sites and Services

Let's say you are the service provider of a small to mid-sized web service with an existing
userbase. 

<div class="text-center">
  <img id="generic-website" src="/assets/img/content/generic-website.png"></img>
</div>

You want to understand what your users are doing and how they interact with your site. Plus you
want to see how the page *feels* for your users.
Using the Boomerang Express your can see what your users are doing. How the page feels for them,
how long it takes for them until the site has loaded etc.

The Concept here is to connect your site with the BoomerangJS script and the Boomerang Express Server
and store all your metrics in Boomerang Express Datastore and let Boomerang Express Analytics visualize
where your performance problems may come from and how to improve.

<div class="text-center" id="combo-three">
<img src="/assets/img/content/generic-website.png"></img>
<img id="icon" src="/assets/img/icon.png"></img>
<img src="/assets/img/content/boomerang-database.png"></img>
</div>

Using the Boomerang Express Analytics frontend you can then understand more fully how your website
is being used and how to improve the paths your users take through the application.
Having a large set of data to rely on in order to get the most out of Boomerang Express is imperative.
