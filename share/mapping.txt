==================================

{
  "v" : "Version number of the boomerang library in use.",
  "u" : "URL of page that sends the beacon.",
  "t_done" : "[optional] Perceived load time of the page.",
  "t_page" : "[optional] Time taken from the head of the page to page_ready."
  "t_resp" : "[optional] Time taken from the user initiating the request to the first byte of the response."
  "t_load" : "[optional] If the page were prerendered, this is the time to fetch and  prerender the page."
  "t_prerender" : "[optional] If the page were prerendered, this is the time from start of prefetch to the actual page display. It may only be useful for  debugging."
  "t_postrender" : "[optional] If the page were prerendered, this is the time from prerender finish to actual page display. It may only be useful for debugging.
  "boomerang" : "The time it took boomerang to load up from first byte to last byte"
  "boomr_fb" : "[optional] The time it took from the start of page load to the first byte of boomerang. Only included if we know when page load started."
  "r" : "URL of page that set the start time of the beacon."
  "r2" : "[optional] URL of referrer of current page. Only set if different from r and strict_referrer has been explicitly turned off."

  "rt_bstart" : "The timestamp when boomerang showed up on the page"
  "rt.end" : "The timestamp when the done() method was called"
  "bw" : "User's measured bandwidth in bytes per second"
  "bw_err" : "95% confidence interval margin of error in measuring user's bandwidth"
  "lat" : "User's measured HTTP latency in milliseconds"
  "lat_err" : "95% confidence interval margin of error in measuring user's latency"
  "bw_time" : "Timestamp (seconds since the epoch) on the user's browser when the bandwidth and latency was measured"
  "dns.t" : "The worst-case DNS latency from the user's browser to your DNS server."
  "ipv6_latency" : "Latency in milliseconds of getting data from an ipv6 host when connecting to the IP. Will be set to NA if the client cannot connect to the ipv6 host."
  "ipv6_lookup" : "Latency of getting data from a hostname that resolves to an ipv6 address. Will be set to NA if the client cannot resolve or connect to the ipv6 host."
